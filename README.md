# todo-app-crud-mean-stack-backend

This is my first project using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node).
It is a simple web application for a todo list with simple CRUD operations.

The main goal of this project is to deploy a tested and secure application written in the best coding practices and following standards.
